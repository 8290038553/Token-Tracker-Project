## Project Title
**Token Tracker for Fitness Goals**

## Project Description
The **Token Tracker for Fitness Goals** is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to incentivize fitness tracking through blockchain technology. By using an ERC-20 token, users can set fitness goals and receive rewards in the form of tokens when they achieve their goals. The contract allows users to set personal fitness goals, track their progress, and receive token rewards for completing them.

## Project Vision
The vision for this project is to integrate fitness motivation with blockchain technology, where users can benefit from achieving personal health goals through token rewards. By using cryptocurrency to incentivize fitness, we aim to create a healthier and more engaged user base.

- Provide users with a transparent and immutable system to track their fitness progress.
- Reward users with tokens based on fitness achievements, creating a financial incentive for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
- Enable users to interact with the contract and manage their fitness goals in a decentralized manner.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with Fitness APIs:** Connect the smart contract with real-world fitness trackers (e.g., Fitbit, Strava, Apple Health) to automate goal tracking and reward issuance.
- **Goal Customization:** Allow users to customize their reward structure (e.g., choose the number of tokens they wish to receive based on the type of fitness activity).
- **NFT Integration:** Users could also earn unique fitness achievement NFTs to represent milestones.
- **Community Engagement:** Enable users to compete with friends or other community members and track global fitness rankings.

## Key Features
- **Fitness Goal Setting:** Users can set personal fitness goals on the blockchain.
- **Token Rewards:** Tokens are awarded when a user achieves their fitness goal.
- **ERC-20 Token:** The contract implements an ERC-20 token standard to ensure seamless integration with other blockchain applications.
- **Decentralized:** The contract operates fully on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to track their own fitness goals and receive rewards based on their achievements.
